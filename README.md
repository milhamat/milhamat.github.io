## Profesional Experience
**National Taipei University of Business (Research Assistant)**
  - Utilize Python, and R to implement Data Visualization and make Dashboard app based on studentâ€™s dataset.
  - Using Python to do the extensive research about applying defect detection using few-shot learning under small class condition, by using image enhancement for data augmentation.

**Ming Chi University of Technology (Research Assistant)**
  - Utilize Python, R and Matlab to implement supervised and unsupervised model.
  - Utilize Python to classify the defect detection on image steel surface using several model and make comparison base on the result performance, comparison of fault detection using dimensional reduction, tree base learning and statistic approach, applied few-shot learning for defect classification in steel surface defect detection.

## Projects
- Campus Data Dashboard App 
  (National Taipei University of Business)
  - Using Shiny (R) and Dash (Python) to make a web data dashboard for National Taipei University of Business student alumni dataset.
- Enhancing Data Through Augmentation to Address Few-class Scenarios of Few-shot Learning
  (Project article-National Taipei University of Business)
  - Another approach of tackling the few-class problem by using image processing method, such as CLAHE, binary inverse to enrich the classes, we also set 
    several dataset conditions that could maximize the models performance, through the experiments
- Steel Surface Defect Classification using Few-Shot Learning
  (Master Thesis-Ming Chi University of Technology)
  - Employing Few-shot learning (Siamese, matching, prototypical network) to classify the defect type from NEU (steel surface defect) image dataset, 
    however due to the few-class problem we use k-means clustering to enrich the dataset, and the experiments show that there is an improve accuracy if we 
    compared to the original dataset.
